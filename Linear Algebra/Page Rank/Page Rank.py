# GRADED FUNCTION
# Complete this function to provide the PageRank for an arbitrarily sized internet.
# I.e. the principal eigenvector of the damped system, using the power iteration method.
# (Normalisation doesn't matter here)
# The functions inputs are the linkMatrix, and d the damping parameter - as defined in this worksheet.

    n = linkMatrix.shape[0]
    
    M = d * linkMatrix + (1-d)/n * np.ones([n, n]) # np.ones() is the J matrix, with ones for each entry.
    r = 100 * np.ones(n) / n # Sets up this vector (n entries of 1/n Ã— 100 each)
    lastR = r
    r = M @ r
    i = 0
